# dita_glossary_example
An example of a converted DITA-based document ("On Yacht Sailing") that implements a glossary. 
This implements one possible version of a glossary based in DITA, where term tags in the the body content point to specific glossentry topics, arranged within the backmatter of a bookmap. This sample goes overboard (pardon the pun) when it comes to referencing terms, as best practice suggests only referencing a term at first instance within a topic, rather than any instance.
